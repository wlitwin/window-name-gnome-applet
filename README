This is a gnome panel applet that will display the current window title.
Created because I'm using XMonad with Gnome fallback and window names are
sometimes helpful. The panel applet has three modes: White title, Gray title,
and No title. The code is pretty hacked together and I have no idea how
to properly use GTK so the applet is actually a button (I wanted to make
it a label).

Use at own risk.
